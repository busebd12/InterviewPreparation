Below are some links that I have found useful in my interview preparation:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSDushJN0E3Xpfe5Y3_Nt8eSXf1N2K4lJXjv_sSS-Cc/edit -- my Google doc review sheet
that has data structure code and other important concepts and information

http://www.careerride.com/C++-Interview-questions-Answer.aspx -- a site that has a TON of information for C++ interviews. 
It reivews important pretty much everything about the language and provides practice tests, interviews, and questions.
